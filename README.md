# squirrel_tracker
1. What has been implemented:  
  We have created two apps, naming 'sightings' and 'map', there are three specific functions in 'sightings' app ,including 'add', adding a new squirrel sighting to the database; 'update', updating the new information about the existing sighting in the initial database, and 'stats', showing some basic statistical information of the squirrel data. 'map' shows exactly where the first 100 sightings in the database are on the map. We render the webpages with Bootstrap and realize the management commands, to import the original csv data and export it.
